# Process Gripper #

# idea #
is to use Python and C++ to create a way to run processes in sandboxes
1. we are not sure if this can be done in pure python, beside extending c++ code into python is not always
 so easy and readable if we would like to keep all c++ classes and functions, possibly we will create some
 demons/services which will communicate with each other (PROTOCOL).

X.
    1. There is a way to be informed with socket descriptor about bunch of information (FORK, SPAWN, SID...) from kernel (NETLINK)
    2. We have inotify-cxx library which watch files and inform about requested operations on files
    X. How two control process calls and operations like through some pipe and decide whether this can be done ?
